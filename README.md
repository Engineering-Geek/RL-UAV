# RL-UAV

RL-UAV is a reinforcement learning project focused on drone simulation. The project is built using Python and JavaScript, and it uses the MuJoCo physics engine for accurate physics simulation.

## Project Structure

The project is divided into several modules, each responsible for a specific functionality:

- `TrainingRegimes`: This module contains the main logic for the drone and target simulation. It includes classes like `Drone`, `Target`, and `_BaseRegime`.

- `tests`: This module contains unit tests for the `TrainingRegimes` module.

- `docs`: This module contains the documentation for the project.

## Installation

To install the project, clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies.

## Usage

To use the project, import the necessary classes from the `TrainingRegimes` module and create instances of them. You can then use these instances to simulate a drone and a target in a 3D environment.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. Please open an issue to discuss your ideas before making a change.
